# CryptoNotes
This is meant to be a super simple tool for encrypting and decrypting personal private notes.

## CLI (Command Line Interface)
The CLI is used through the `cli.js` file.
The CLI has no external reference to increase security.

### Using CLI
Here are the different commands

```
$ node cli encrypt <content> [encoding]
```

```
$ node cli decrypt <content> [encoding] [outputEncoding]
```

The possible encodings are:
* `hex` for hexadecimal
* `base64` for Base64

## Web tool
The web tool is a user friendly version.
For the moment, it is located under https://diegogurpegui.com/cryptonotes/
